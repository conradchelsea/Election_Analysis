# Election Analysis with Python

## Project Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections tasked me with completing a vote count report to certify a local election. 
They have asked I specifically:
	1. Collect the total number of votes.
	2. Collect the number of votes for each candidate.
	3. Calculate the percentage of votes for each candidate. 
	4. Determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote.  

## Resources
	- Data Source: election_results.csv
	- Sotware: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.49.2

## Summary
 The analysis of the data collected for this election shows that the total votes tallied 369,711. 
 Further breakdown indicated:
 	- Diana DeGette was the winner, receiving 272,892 of the votes equalling 73.8%.
	- Charles Casper Stockham recieved 85,213 votes at 23%.
	- Raymond Anthony Doane received 11,606 votes making up the final 3%.

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The amount of information was lengthy and dense. Sorting through it and organizing was time consuming for me. Fortunately, Python made it easier to analyze the data and calculate the outcome.
